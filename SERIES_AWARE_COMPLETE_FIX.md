# Complete Series-Aware Implementation for iOS App

## Overview
Made the iOS app fully series-aware across all tabs: **Scanner**, **Gates**, **Wristbands**, and **Analytics**. The app now correctly handles both parent events and series events throughout the entire user experience.

## Database Schema Reminder

### Wristbands
```
Parent Event: event_id = parent ID, series_id = NULL
Series Event: event_id = parent ID, series_id = series ID
```

### Check-in Logs
```
Parent Event: event_id = parent ID, series_id = NULL
Series Event: event_id = parent ID, series_id = series ID
```

### Gates
```
Parent Event: event_id = parent ID, series_id = NULL
Series Event: event_id = parent ID, series_id = series ID
```

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ **Scanner Tab** (`DatabaseScannerViewModel.swift`)

#### Event Context Validation (Step 3)
- **Series Events**: Validates wristband belongs to current series by checking `wristband.seriesId == currentEvent.seriesId`
- **Parent Events**: Validates wristband belongs to parent event AND not a series by checking `wristband.eventId == eventId && wristband.seriesId == nil`
- **Result**: Prevents scanning wrong event/series wristbands

#### Check-in Logging (Step 8)
- **Series Events**: 
  - Fetches parent event ID from wristband
  - Logs with `event_id = parent ID` and `series_id = series ID`
- **Parent Events**:
  - Logs with `event_id = parent ID` and `series_id = NULL`
- **Result**: Check-ins are correctly associated with both parent and series

### 2. ✅ **Gates Tab** (`GatesViewModel.swift`)

#### Gate Fetching (`loadAllData`)
- **Series Events**: Queries `v_gates_complete?series_id=eq.<series_id>`
- **Parent Events**: Queries `v_gates_complete?event_id=eq.<event_id>&series_id=is.null`
- **Result**: Shows only gates relevant to current context

#### Gate Fetching with Counts (`fetchGates`)
- **Series Events**: Queries `gates?series_id=eq.<series_id>&select=*,checkin_count:checkin_logs(count)`
- **Parent Events**: Queries `gates?event_id=eq.<event_id>&series_id=is.null&select=*,checkin_count:checkin_logs(count)`
- **Result**: Accurate gate statistics for each context

#### Fallback Gate Fetching
- **Series Events**: Queries `gates?series_id=eq.<series_id>`
- **Parent Events**: Queries `gates?event_id=eq.<event_id>&series_id=is.null`
- **Result**: Consistent behavior even in fallback scenarios

### 3. ✅ **Wristbands Tab** (`DatabaseWristbandsView.swift`)
*Already fixed in previous implementation*

#### Wristband Fetching
- **Series Events**: Calls `fetchWristbandsForSeries(seriesId)`
- **Parent Events**: Calls `fetchWristbands(eventId)` with `series_id=is.null` filter
- **Result**: Shows only wristbands for current context

#### Check-in Log Fetching
- **Series Events**: Calls `fetchCheckinLogsForSeries(seriesId)`
- **Parent Events**: Calls `fetchCheckinLogs(eventId)`
- **Result**: Shows check-in status correctly for each wristband

#### Manual Check-in
- **Series Events**: Uses parent event ID and series ID
- **Parent Events**: Uses event ID only
- **Result**: Check-ins logged correctly in database

### 4. ✅ **Analytics Tab** (`DatabaseStatsView.swift`)
*Already fixed in previous implementation*

#### Stats Fetching
- **Series Events**: Passes `seriesId` to `fetchEventStats()`
- **Parent Events**: Passes `nil` for `seriesId`
- **Result**: Shows accurate analytics for each context

#### Event Stats Method (`SupabaseService.fetchEventStats`)
- **Series Events**: 
  - Fetches wristbands by `series_id`
  - Fetches check-in logs by `series_id`
- **Parent Events**:
  - Fetches wristbands by `event_id` with `series_id=is.null`
  - Fetches check-in logs by `event_id`
- **Result**: Category breakdowns and metrics are context-specific

✅ [DEBUG] Step 3 SUCCESS: Wristband belongs to current series

📝 [DEBUG] Step 8: Logging SERIES check-in - Parent Event: <parent_id>, Series: <series_id>
✅ [DEBUG] Step 8 SUCCESS: Check-in logged successfully
```

### Gates Tab
```
🔄 Fetching gates from v_gates_complete view for SERIES: <series_id>
✅ Loaded X gates from v_gates_complete

## Database Queries

### Scanner - Event Context Check (Series)

```

### Scanner - Check-in Log (Series)
```sql
INSERT INTO checkin_logs (
  event_id,      -- Parent Event ID (from wristband)

  wristband_id,
  gate_id,
  staff_id,

SELECT * FROM v_gates_complete
WHERE series_id = '<series_id>'
```

### Gates - Fetch Gates (Parent)

## Result

🎉 **The iOS app is now fully series-aware!**

✅ **Scanner Tab**: Validates and logs check-ins correctly for series and parent events  
✅ **Gates Tab**: Shows gates specific to series or parent event context  
✅ **Wristbands Tab**: Displays and manages wristbands for correct context  
✅ **Analytics Tab**: Shows accurate stats for series or parent events  

✅ **No double counting**: Each wristband, check-in, and gate belongs to exactly one context  
✅ **Proper separation**: Series data doesn't mix with parent event data  
✅ **Matches web portal**: iOS app behavior is consistent with web portal
