## 🗣️ Common Questions & Responses

### **Q: "How do I add staff members?"**
**A:**
> "They self-register. Just send them the app, they create their account with their work email. You can then assign their role and event permissions from your admin dashboard."

---

### **Q: "What if someone loses their phone?"**
**A:**
> "All credentials are on their device in the secure Keychain. If they lose their phone, they just log into a new device with their email and password. Old device sessions expire automatically."

---

### **Q: "Is Face ID secure enough?"**
**A:**
> "Face ID uses the same encryption as Apple Pay and banking apps. The facial data never leaves the device, and we only receive a 'yes' or 'no' authentication result. It's actually MORE secure than passwords because it can't be guessed or shared."

---

### **Q: "What if WiFi goes down at the event?"**
**A:**
> "The app caches sessions. Staff who logged in earlier stay logged in. Check-ins continue offline and sync when connection returns. Authentication works without internet."

---

### **Q: "Can I force all staff to change passwords?"**
**A:**
> "Yes, through the admin dashboard you can invalidate all sessions or specific users, forcing re-authentication with new passwords."

---

### **Q: "How do you prevent unauthorized access?"**
**A:**
> "Multiple layers: JWT tokens that expire hourly, refresh tokens for convenience, role-based permissions, and admin controls to deactivate staff instantly. Plus all data is encrypted at rest and in transit."

> "While this loads, let me explain our offline capabilities..."

### If app crashes:
> "That's actually a good demonstration of our error recovery—watch how quickly we restore..."

### If forgot password email is delayed:
> "Email typically arrives in seconds, but let's move to the next feature while we wait..."
