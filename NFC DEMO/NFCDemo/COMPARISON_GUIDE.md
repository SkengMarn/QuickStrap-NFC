## 💡 Myth vs. Reality

### Myth #1: "NFC is too expensive"
**Reality:** NFC wristbands cost $0.50-2.00 each. Cheaper than printing and distributing paper tickets. Plus, ROI from fraud prevention and labor savings pays for itself in one event.

### Myth #2: "NFC requires expensive hardware"
**Reality:** Just use iPhones (7+). Most venues already have these or staff have personal phones.

### Myth #3: "Setup is complicated"
**Reality:** 20-minute event setup, 15-minute staff training. Easier than traditional systems.

### Myth #4: "It only works online"
**Reality:** Full offline capability. Actually works BETTER offline than QR codes!

### Myth #5: "Attendees won't understand it"
**Reality:** Tap wrist to phone. If they can use Apple Pay, they can use this. Actually SIMPLER than QR codes.

### Myth #6: "It's only for huge events"
**Reality:** Scales perfectly from 50 to 50,000+ attendees. Small events benefit even more (setup is just as fast!).
