## Key Findings Summary

### What Works Today (Ready to Use)

- [x] active_sessions table - Real-time user presence
- [x] presenceService - Session lifecycle management  
- [x] ActiveSessionsTable - Live dashboard component
- [x] Device detection - Via User-Agent parsing
- [x] Resource locks - Prevent edit conflicts
- [x] Audit logging - Security event tracking
- [x] Organization isolation - Multi-tenant support

### What's Missing (Needs Implementation)

- [ ] app_logins table - NFC app-specific tracking
- [ ] appLoginService - App login recording
- [ ] API endpoint - For app to report login
- [ ] App version tracking - No version field yet
- [ ] Device ID tracking - Only User-Agent stored
- [ ] Failed login tracking - No failure_reason field
- [ ] Login method tracking - Credential vs. biometric

### Critical Gaps

1. **Sessions created on FIRST NAVIGATION, not login** - Can't see exact login time
2. **App detection via User-Agent strings** - Inconsistent from NFC app
3. **No app-specific session table** - Can't easily query "all iOS logins"
4. **Missing user_sessions/telegram_sessions tables** - Referenced but not created

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Planning (Days 1-2)
- Review analysis with team
- Choose: app_logins table vs. enhanced active_sessions
- Design database schema
- Define API contract

### Phase 2: Backend (Days 3-5)
- Create database migration
- Implement appLoginService
- Create API endpoint with rate limiting
- Add RLS policies

### Phase 3: Integration (Days 6-7)
- Update NFC app to report logins
- Test end-to-end
- Verify data collection

### Phase 4: Analytics (Week 2)
- Build app session dashboard
- Add geographic tracking
- Create reporting queries

### Phase 5: Advanced (Week 3+)
- Anomaly detection (ML)
- Device fingerprinting
- Risk scoring
- Fraud detection integration

---

## Key Statistics

### Database Tables
- **active_sessions**: ~100 rows (real-time)
- **resource_locks**: ~10-50 rows (active edits)
- **collaboration_activity**: Historical growth
- **app_logins** (proposed): ~1000-5000 rows/day

### Performance
- Session cleanup: Every 1 hour (automatic)
- Session timeout: 24 hours (configurable)
- Activity refresh: 30-second intervals
- Last activity tracked: Real-time (every navigation)

### Coverage
- Tracks desktop, mobile, tablet users
- Detects Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge browsers
- Detects Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS
- Knows current portal route and resource viewing
- IP address logging enabled

---

## Security Considerations

### Already Implemented
- [x] IP address logging
- [x] Device type detection
- [x] Organization isolation
- [x] Session invalidation
- [x] Audit logging
- [x] Rate limiting on login

### Needed for App Tracking
- [ ] RLS policies for organization isolation
- [ ] GDPR privacy policy for device IDs
- [ ] Rate limiting on login endpoint
- [ ] Failed login attempt throttling
- [ ] IP address encryption in database
- [ ] User consent flows
- [ ] Session timeout per organization
