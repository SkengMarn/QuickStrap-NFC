# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
## NFC Wristband Event Check-In System

---

## 🎯 General Questions

### What is this product?
Our NFC wristband check-in system is a comprehensive event management solution that uses contactless NFC technology to streamline attendee entry, track movement, and prevent fraud. It's designed for festivals, concerts, conferences, and any event requiring fast, secure access control.

### How does it work?
Attendees wear NFC-enabled wristbands. Staff members use the mobile app to scan wristbands at entry points. The system instantly validates access based on ticket type, gate permissions, and entry rules—all in real-time.

### What makes this different from traditional ticketing?
- **Instant validation** - No barcode scanning delays or printed tickets
- **Fraud prevention** - Each wristband is unique and can't be duplicated
- **Real-time insights** - See who's inside your event as it happens
- **Contactless entry** - Just tap and go—faster than scanning tickets
- **Re-entry support** - Attendees can leave and return seamlessly

## 🎫 Ticketing & Wristbands

### Do I need to link tickets to wristbands?
You choose! Our system supports three modes:
- **Disabled** - No ticket linking required (wristband-only events)
- **Optional** - Link tickets for better tracking, but not required for entry
- **Required** - Every wristband must be linked to a valid ticket before entry

### Can one ticket be used for multiple wristbands?
Yes! You can configure category-based limits. For example, a VIP ticket might allow 2 wristbands (guest +1), while General Admission allows only 1.

### What happens if someone loses their wristband?
Staff can easily unlink the old wristband and assign a new one to the same ticket. The system maintains a complete audit trail of all changes.

### Can attendees with the same ticket enter at the same time?
The system detects re-entry attempts within 30 minutes. This prevents ticket sharing while allowing legitimate re-entry (like stepping out for a phone call).

## 🚪 Access Control & Gates

### How do gate restrictions work?
You define which wristband categories can access which gates. For example:
- VIP wristbands → All gates
- General Admission → Main entrance only
- Backstage Pass → Stage entrance only

### Can I have time-based access?
Yes! Configure access windows for different areas. Early bird ticket holders can enter at 2 PM, general admission at 4 PM, etc.

### What if someone tries to enter the wrong gate?
The app immediately shows "Access Denied" with a clear reason (e.g., "VIP access required"). Staff knows exactly why entry was blocked.

---

## 📱 Mobile App

### What devices work with the app?
iOS devices with NFC capability (iPhone 7 and newer). The app works offline and syncs when connected.

### Do staff need constant internet connection?
No! The app works offline and caches essential data. It syncs check-ins automatically when connectivity returns.

### How fast is the check-in process?
**Under 2 seconds per person.** Just tap the wristband to the phone—instant validation.

### Can multiple staff members scan simultaneously?
Absolutely! Unlimited staff devices can scan at the same time. Perfect for high-traffic entry points.

## 🔒 Security & Fraud Prevention

### How do you prevent counterfeit wristbands?
- Each wristband has a **unique encrypted NFC chip**
- Wristbands not registered in your database are rejected
- Real-time validation against your event database

### What if someone tries to share a wristband?
The system detects suspicious patterns:
- Multiple check-ins from the same wristband at different gates
- Check-ins that violate time/location logic
- Category limit violations

### Can staff override blocked entries?
Admins can configure override permissions. All overrides are logged with staff ID, timestamp, and reason for complete accountability.

### Is attendee data secure?
Yes. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We use enterprise-grade Supabase infrastructure with row-level security policies.

## 📊 Analytics & Reporting

### What kind of data can I see?
Real-time dashboards show:
- **Total check-ins** (today and all-time)
- **Success rate** by gate and category
- **Peak traffic times** and flow patterns
- **Fraud attempts** and blocked entries
- **No-show tracking** (tickets linked but never checked in)
- **Unique vs. re-entry** counts

### Can I export reports?
Yes! Export check-in logs, analytics, and audit trails in CSV format for post-event analysis.

### How do I know if there's a problem at a gate?
The dashboard shows live metrics. If a gate has high rejection rates or long wait times, you'll see it immediately.
