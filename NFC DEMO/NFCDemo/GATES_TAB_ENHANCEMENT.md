let gates = (try? await fetchGates(eventId: eventId)) ?? []
let bindings = (try? await fetchBindings(eventId: eventId)) ?? []
let stats = (try? await fetchTimeFilteredStats(eventId: eventId))
```

### Time-Filtered Queries
- Only fetches data for selected time range
- Reduces payload size for large events
- Server-side filtering where possible
- Client-side aggregation for complex stats

### Map Optimizations
- Auto-clustering for many gates (future)
- Efficient coordinate calculations
- Lazy loading of gate details
- Region-based updates

---

## 🔧 Configuration & Customization

### Deduplication Threshold
Location in `GateDeduplicationService.swift`:
```swift
struct SmartThresholds {
    static let indoorVenue: Double = 20.0      // Hotels, conference centers
    static let urbanVenue: Double = 30.0       // City locations with GPS interference
    static let outdoorVenue: Double = 50.0     // Open spaces, festivals
    static let defaultThreshold: Double = 25.0 // Current default
}
```

**How to Adjust**:
1. Identify venue type (indoor/urban/outdoor)
2. Update `defaultThreshold` or use context-aware selection
3. Higher values = fewer duplicates detected
4. Lower values = more aggressive deduplication

### Time Ranges
Location in `GatesViewModel.swift`:
```swift
enum TimeRange: String, CaseIterable {
    case today = "Today"
    case week = "This Week"
    case month = "This Month"
    case all = "All Time"
}
```

**How to Add Custom Range**:
1. Add case to enum (e.g., `case yesterday = "Yesterday"`)
2. Add icon in `var icon: String`
3. Add date range in `var dateRange: (start: Date, end: Date)`
4. UI will automatically update

## 🎯 Use Cases & Workflows

### Scenario 1: Event Setup
**Problem**: Need to verify gates are properly positioned

**Workflow**:
1. Open Gates tab
2. Tap "Map" view mode
3. Verify all gates appear at correct GPS coordinates
4. Check for any obvious duplicates (overlapping pins)
5. Use deduplication if needed

### Scenario 2: Real-time Monitoring
**Problem**: Need to see which gates are busiest during event

**Workflow**:
1. Stay in List view
2. Select "Last Hour" time range
3. Scroll to "Active Gates" section
4. Gates are sorted by scan count (highest first)
5. Tap gate for detailed timeline

### Scenario 3: Post-Event Analysis
**Problem**: Need to understand gate utilization over entire event

**Workflow**:
1. Select "All Time" time range
2. Review "Category Distribution" chart
3. Check "System Health" section for data quality
4. Export data for external analysis
5. View "Activity Timeline" for peak hours

### Scenario 4: Data Quality Check
**Problem**: High number of unlinked check-ins

**Workflow**:
1. Check "System Health" section
2. Note "Gate Coverage" percentage (should be >80%)
3. If low, switch to Map view to identify coverage gaps
4. Use deduplication to merge duplicates causing linking issues
5. Refresh and verify improvement

## 🐛 Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- Map requires GPS coordinates (some gates may not have them)
- Deduplication is manual (requires user to initiate)
- No bulk gate operations (edit multiple gates at once)
- Export is CSV only (no Excel, PDF, or visual reports)

### Planned Enhancements
- **Auto-deduplication**: Automatically merge duplicates above confidence threshold
- **Gate creation from map**: Long-press to create new gate at location
- **Live check-in animation**: Show check-ins appearing in real-time on map
- **Heatmap overlay**: Show check-in density as colored overlay
- **Gate grouping**: Organize gates into zones (e.g., VIP, General, Staff)
- **Advanced filters**: Filter by status, confidence, time of day, etc.
- **Predictive analytics**: Forecast gate load based on historical data

## 📝 Developer Notes

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] List view displays all gates correctly
- [ ] Map view centers on gates automatically
- [ ] Deduplication detects duplicates accurately
- [ ] View mode switching preserves data
- [ ] Time filtering updates all sections
- [ ] Export generates valid CSV
- [ ] Haptic feedback works on all buttons
- [ ] VoiceOver navigation is logical
- [ ] Empty states show helpful messages
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Map shows all gates at (0, 0)
**Solution**: Gates are missing latitude/longitude. Check database and ensure location is captured during check-in.

**Issue**: Deduplication finds no duplicates when there should be some
**Solution**: Threshold may be too strict. Increase `defaultThreshold` in `GateDeduplicationService.swift`.

**Issue**: Time filtering shows no data
**Solution**: Check selected time range. If "Today" shows nothing, event may not have activity today. Switch to "All Time".

**Issue**: Performance slow with many gates
**Solution**: Implement pagination in `GatesViewModel`. Currently loads all gates at once.
