5. **Allow reasonable time** for us to respond and fix

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** assessment
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Within 7 days for critical issues
- **Release**: As soon as testing is complete
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed (coordinated disclosure)

## üèÜ Security Acknowledgments

We appreciate security researchers who help us keep QuickStrap NFC secure:

- **Hall of Fame**: Coming soon
- **Responsible Disclosure**: We follow coordinated disclosure practices
- **Recognition**: Security contributors will be acknowledged (with permission)

## üîß Security Best Practices for Developers

### Code Security
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated

### Configuration Security
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper key rotation procedures
- Use secure defaults for all configurations
- Regular security audits of configuration files

### Testing Security
- Include security tests in your test suite
- Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Perform regular penetration testing
- Use static analysis tools
- Implement continuous security monitoring

## üîç Security Tools and Processes

### Automated Security
- **Static Analysis**: SwiftLint with security rules
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability checks
- **Code Review**: Security-focused peer reviews
- **CI/CD Security**: Secure build and deployment pipelines

### Manual Security
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Code Audits**: Manual security code reviews
- **Architecture Reviews**: Security architecture validation
- **Threat Modeling**: Regular threat assessment updates
