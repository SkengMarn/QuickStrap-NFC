# Series Check-in and Analytics Fix

## Problem
Manual check-ins and analytics were not working correctly for series events because:
1. Check-in logs were being created with the wrong `event_id` (series ID instead of parent event ID)
2. Check-in logs weren't including the `series_id` column
3. Analytics queries were fetching data by `event_id` only, missing series-specific check-ins

## Database Schema for Check-ins
```
For Parent Event Check-ins:
  event_id = Parent Event ID
  series_id = NULL

For Series Event Check-ins:
  event_id = Parent Event ID (FK requirement)
  series_id = Series ID
```

## Changes Made

### 1. **CheckinLog Model** (`DatabaseModels.swift`)
- âœ… Added `seriesId: String?` property to track series check-ins
- âœ… Updated `CodingKeys` to include `seriesId = "series_id"`

### 2. **SupabaseService - recordCheckIn** (`SupabaseService.swift`)
- âœ… Added `seriesId` parameter to method signature
- âœ… Updated to include `series_id` in check-in data when provided
- âœ… Logs now correctly store both parent event ID and series ID

### 3. **SupabaseService - fetchCheckinLogsForSeries** (`SupabaseService.swift`)
- âœ… Added new method to fetch check-in logs by `series_id`
- âœ… Query: `rest/v1/checkin_logs?series_id=eq.\(seriesId)&order=timestamp.desc&limit=\(limit)`

### 4. **SupabaseService - fetchEventStats** (`SupabaseService.swift`)
- âœ… Added optional `seriesId` parameter
- âœ… Fetches wristbands and check-in logs based on series vs parent event context
- âœ… For series: queries by `series_id`
- âœ… For parent events: queries by `event_id` with `series_id IS NULL` filter

### 5. **DatabaseWristbandsView - manualCheckIn** (`DatabaseWristbandsView.swift`)
- âœ… Updated to determine correct `event_id` and `series_id` based on context
- âœ… For series events:
  - Uses `wristband.eventId` (parent event ID) for `event_id`
  - Uses `currentEvent.seriesId` for `series_id`
- âœ… For parent events:
  - Uses `currentEvent.id` for `event_id`
  - Sets `series_id` to `nil`

### 6. **DatabaseWristbandsView - loadData** (`DatabaseWristbandsView.swift`)
- âœ… Updated to fetch check-in logs using the correct method:
  - Series events: calls `fetchCheckinLogsForSeries(seriesId)`
  - Parent events: calls `fetchCheckinLogs(eventId)`

### 7. **DatabaseStatsView - loadStats** (`DatabaseStatsView.swift`)
- âœ… Updated to pass `seriesId` to `fetchEventStats`
- âœ… Analytics now correctly show series-specific data

## Result

### Manual Check-in
âœ… **Parent events**: Check-ins logged with `event_id = parent ID`, `series_id = NULL`  
âœ… **Series events**: Check-ins logged with `event_id = parent ID`, `series_id = series ID`  
âœ… **Correct association**: Check-ins are properly linked to both parent and series  
âœ… **Check-in status**: Wristbands correctly show as checked-in after manual check-in

### Analytics Tab
âœ… **Parent events**: Shows analytics for parent event wristbands only  
âœ… **Series events**: Shows analytics for series-specific wristbands and check-ins  
âœ… **Category breakdown**: Correctly calculated for each context  
âœ… **Recent activity**: Shows check-ins relevant to the current view  
âœ… **Time-based stats**: Filtered correctly by series or parent event

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Check-in Feature
1. âœ… Open a **series event** (e.g., "Match Day 1")
2. âœ… Navigate to **Wristbands** tab
3. âœ… Tap "Check In" on a wristband
4. âœ… Verify wristband shows as checked-in (green checkmark)
5. âœ… Check database: `checkin_logs` should have:
   - `event_id` = parent event ID
   - `series_id` = series ID
   - `wristband_id` = wristband ID

### Analytics Tab
1. âœ… Open a **series event**
2. âœ… Navigate to **Analytics** tab
3. âœ… Verify stats show:
   - Total wristbands for this series
   - Check-ins for this series only
   - Category breakdown for series wristbands
4. âœ… Open a **parent event**
5. âœ… Verify stats show:
   - Total wristbands for parent event (excluding series)
   - Check-ins for parent event only
   - Category breakdown for parent wristbands

## Database Queries

### Manual Check-in (Series Event)
```sql
INSERT INTO checkin_logs (
  event_id,      -- Parent Event ID
  series_id,     -- Series ID
  wristband_id,
  staff_id,
  timestamp,
  location,
  notes
) VALUES (...)
```

### Fetch Check-in Logs (Series Event)
```sql
SELECT * FROM checkin_logs
WHERE series_id = '<series_id>'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 100
```

### Fetch Analytics (Series Event)
```sql
-- Wristbands
SELECT * FROM wristbands
WHERE series_id = '<series_id>'
AND is_active = true

-- Check-in Logs
SELECT * FROM checkin_logs
WHERE series_id = '<series_id>'
AND timestamp >= '<start_date>'
AND timestamp <= '<end_date>'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
```

## Logging
Enhanced logging for debugging:
- `ðŸ”„ Starting manual check-in for SERIES wristband: <nfc_id>`
- `   Parent Event ID: <parent_id>, Series ID: <series_id>`
- `âœ… Manual check-in successful for <category> wristband: <nfc_id>`
- `ðŸ“Š Fetching stats for SERIES: <series_id>`
- `âœ… Fetched X wristbands and Y logs for series <series_id>`
